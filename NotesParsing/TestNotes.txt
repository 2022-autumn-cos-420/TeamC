ERS 101 Lecture 9/24 Earthquakes CH.8


Earthquake: A vibration caused by the sudden breaking or frictional sliding of rock in the Earth


Seismology: Study of EQs, ‘seismos’ is Greek for ‘shocks’


* Most EQs are caused by built-up stress along faults, which propagates energy through the crust when the stress is released


{Fault: Fracture on which one rock slides past another}


{Hypocenter (focus): Actual location of the EQ}


{Epicenter: Point on the Earth’s surface directly above the hypocenter}
  
  



Types of Faults


{Normal Fault: A fault where the hanging wall moves down}


{Reverse/Thrust Fault: A fault where the Hanging wall moves up}


{Strike-slip Fault: No up or down movement, just horizontal   
(fault is near vertical)  }


















                                Footwall, Hanging wall



The hanging wall is on the left/higher up (in pic)




Hazards


Gas line ruptures, a cause for fires


* Some fires can be more damaging than the original EQ


* Alaska 1964 EQ


{Tsunami: Caused by a displacement of water}


{Landslides: potentially damming rivers or breaking dams}
* Steep slopes and weak bedrock are most likely to fail


{Liquefaction: Eruption of wet fine sediment from shallow underground to the surface}
