## Mission Statement:
"Promoting an education for all"

## Problem:
In computing education, oftentimes we are presented with very complicated information which is hard to remember. As a result of such an informationally dense field, students often forget key pieces of work which can hinder the quality of their life and the quality of their grades, potentially leading them to drop out of their degree program. Sorting through a vast pile of notes just minutes before an exam is not a productive way to remember the information contained in those notes. Students do not review study material frequently enough to remember and comprehend it which leads to failure to learn earlier material. Text editors such as google docs offer great ways to record notes but do not offer the ability to quickly transcribe to notecards or study reviews. Study tools such as Quizlet require time-consuming creation of flashcards from scratch instead of using studentâ€™s notes in other applications. How can we help students remember material more effectively by lowering the cost of making study materials and reviewing them?
