Mission Statement:
"Promoting an education for all"

Problem:
Education in Computing is an ever-changing field , as technologies advance so to do the challenges facing students' learning increase. Computing students face a multitude of challenges which may go on to have a negative impact on a studentâ€™s learning and quality of life, from out-dated resources to all-nighter homework or project sessions. Why is it that using online resources such as Github or Google send us to threads which are from 5-10 years ago when we want to solve contemporary issues. Have we not made progress in solving such simple issues?

Meeting Schedule:
Weekly meeting: Friday 2:15-3PM
Scrums: Monday and Wednesday 9-9:15AM
Flexible Meetings: Friday 9-9:30AM and Saturday 10-10:30AM

Communication Policies:
1.Meetings will normally be done on Discord. In the case of more complex parts of the project or pressing deadlines, we will arrange to meet in person on campus. 
2.Time-sensitive communication will be done by email, while less urgent communication and records will be done through Discord text channels. 
3.We will use @everyone when anyone may be able to help with the issue or it pertains to the entire group.
4.If the question isn't directed at a single person then anyone should contribute relevant information if they can. If they don't have an answer they should say so, and if someone has said something which they agree with they can react to it to show that it reflects their response as well.
