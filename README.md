## Mission Statement:
"Promoting an education for all"

## Problem:
Education in Computing is an ever-changing field, as technologies advance so do the challenges facing student's learning increase. Computing students face a multitude of challenges which may go on to have a negative impact on a studentâ€™s learning and quality of life, from out-dated resources to all-nighter homework or project sessions. Why is it that using online resources such as Github or Google send us to threads which are from 5-10 years ago when we want to solve contemporary issues. Have we not made progress in solving such simple issues?
