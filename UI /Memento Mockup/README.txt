Setting up and building:
In order to test our HTML and CSS code:
1. Download Folder "Memento Mockup"
2. Run mk1.html on local machine
3. Thats it!

Currently because this is just a very basic launching off point with only html and css, there is no npm to run or anything to install, simply run in an internet browser.
